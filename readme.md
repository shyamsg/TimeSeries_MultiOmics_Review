# Systematic Review Repository

## Purpose of This Repository
Welcome to the **Systematic Review Repository**! This repository has been created to support a systematic review aimed for publication in a high-impact factor journal. The purpose of this repository is to ensure **transparency, reproducibility, and accessibility** of all data, methodologies, and analyses used in the review process.

Here, you will find well-organized data, scripts, and documentation related to different aspects of the systematic review. The repository is structured to facilitate collaboration and allow researchers to easily access relevant information based on their specific interests.

## Repository Structure

### 1. **Literature Search ("/literature_search")**
   - Contains search strategies, keywords, and databases used for retrieving relevant studies.
   - Includes details on inclusion/exclusion criteria and PRISMA flowchart.
   
### 2. **Screening & Data Extraction ("/screening_data_extraction")**
   - Includes screening forms, data extraction templates, and guidelines.
   - Provides summaries of extracted data from selected studies.
   
### 3. **Quality Assessment ("/quality_assessment")**
